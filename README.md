# 🔐 User Anomaly Detection 

## 🧠 Project Objective
This project aims to detect fraudulent users such as bots, spam accounts, and fake profiles on a simulated social media platform. 
By analyzing user behavior metrics — including login frequency, post-to-like ratios, session time, and unusual interaction patterns — we apply machine learning techniques to identify anomalies in user activity.

This is inspired by real-world problems tackled by Trust & Safety teams at companies like YouTube, Twitter, and Meta to ensure user integrity, content authenticity, and platform health.
